infiniteMonkey
=============

If we have infinite number of monkey, gathered them together and let them hit the key of typewriter keyboard randomly for an infinite amount of time. The result of that could create the complete works of William Shakespeare.

infiniteMonkey is the writing collaboration platform. This is not another wikipeadia, its not about knowledge but it is all about writing. I believe in words and language as a medium to carry informations, emotions and believes. 

## Concept

I believe in crowd sourcing platform.

## We are all the monkeys
